      "Virtual leadership certification focusing on effectively managing virtual teams. Addresses challenges of communication, trust, and collaboration. ORBIT is a 4-week virtual leadership certification designed to improve leaders’ ability to effectively manage a virtual team. Successful leadership for virtual teams is becoming increasingly important in today’s global and ambiguous work environment as these teams present a particular set of challenges. Virtual teams lack the informal, everyday conversations that co-located employees take for granted such as sharing information at the water cooler or solving problems on the coffee station. They are deprived of non-verbal cues that indicate whether a colleague is on board or not. Building trust is challenging when feedback is not frequent or facilitated effectively. ORBIT is 100% virtual and through a series of workshops, online resources, offline assignments as well as collaboration and networking with fellow leaders, participants will examine the unique opportunities and challenges that come with virtual work and explore strategies to enhance their ability to lead their virtual teams to success. As a blended-learning strategy, ORBIT combines both virtual instructor-led training and a mix of offline/online activities integrating technology to boost learning and deliver business impact.",

The coaching provided mainly focuses on present and future interactions with the purpose of allowing the 'coachee' to self-discover actions that lead to positive behavioral change. In this partnership, the 'coachee' determines the goals, while enabling the coach to hold them accountable to the goals established. The benefit of having an executive coach is having a customized development opportunity, specifically tailored to the needs of the individual leader. Other benefits include increased self awareness, new approaches to managing situations, which build on top of current strengths, and fresh perspective around career planning and development.

The Thrive Program and Product team have determined that there will be no new onboarding of user groups in the tool, no new product development features and no new dashboard development features. At this time, we cannot provide a date when our intakes will re-open. With the recent org changes and GOLD re-scope to support Ops Field only, the Thrive program (GOLD) and product (Consumer TM) teams are taking this time to collaborate and align on the future of Thrive, as this platform is used across WW Amazon Stores. As we are navigating these conversations, we are working on how we can provide the best customer experience in Thrive. With the limited existing resourcing and conversations about future development still ongoing, we have determined that at this time, we have gone into KTLO. Please note, that While in KTLO, the process for existing user stays the same and Thrive 1-1 conversations should continue. There are currently no plans to deprecate Thrive. Please check regularly the WIKI as We are eager to share more with you more information when the time comes. If you have any further questions regarding KTLO, please reach out to your Thrive POC.",

      "The purpose of the WWCS BLNA Sponsorship Program is to provide Black, Latinx, and Native American leaders equity in career and leadership development by providing an intentional opportunity for executive exposure throughout the leader's tenure within the organization. BLNA Sponsorship Program is a voluntary program developed by Customer Service Learning Talent and Development.  The program was developed to provide selected Black, Latinx and Native American L4 to L7 leaders the opportunity to partner with a designated leader two levels above them within the WWCS organization to focus on specific growth areas for career development. This designated leader will act as the Sponsor for this developmental partnership that takes place in a 1-on-1 format. Each BLNA Sponsorship Program candidate will spend up to 11 months in the Sponsorship cycle. The Sponsor (who is not tied to the Sponsee's immediate reporting structure) will provide a fresh perspective and non-biased observations based on organizational influences. The Sponsor will focus on present and future interactions with the purpose of allowing the Sponsee to self-discover actions that lead to positive behavioral change and/or reinforcement. In this partnership, the Sponsee and Sponsor will both determine the developmental goals. This enables both parties to hold themselves accountable to expectations and milestones. The BLNA Sponsorship Program offers a safe space for intense reflection and tailored development based on established S.M.A.R.T. goals.",

As we learn together, we will focus on consistent and sustained action, knowing that our collective learning cannot undo 400+ years of systemic racism in the United States, nor the pandemic within pandemics – COVID-19, homophobia, anti-Semitism, ageism, ableism, transphobia, sexism, sizism, classism, and much more. What our learning can do, however, is, help to create the change we seek, as we interact with each other, and the customers and candidates who we serve. Together, we will reexamine history, ask questions, listen to the stories of others, and believe them. Together, we will identify the skills and resources we already have and those we seek to develop. We will identify the ways in which we are still complicit to injustice, and learn to create spaces for reciprocity and hope. Our work began as a series of courageous conversations about race, and the provided learning resources will continue to focus on injustice in the United States. We do this work to retain and support inclusive work environments for our current and future colleagues, while increasing diversity at Amazon. ",

Instead of writing out HTML in native perl code, Catalyst dispatches to many kinds of display languages, including Mason and Template Toolkit. Instead of writing a messy CGI that developers will hate you for later on, write a nice clean web application in Catalyst! ",

      "Developmental program augmented by mentorship supporting L4+ women leaders in Operations and Ops Support roles across ECCF, Japan, and China. Amazon Women in Leadership (AWIL) is a developmental program augmented by mentorship supporting L4+ women leaders in Operations and Ops Support roles across ECCF, Japan, and China. Five women leaders are paired with a mentor, who meet monthly to discuss one topic from our curated content library of leadership topics. The program spans a six-month period, with the opportunity for mentees to re-enroll as often as they wish. The purpose of this program is to increase women leader engagement, develop their skills, foster an inclusive working environment and create a safe space for women to discuss issues they deal with in the workplace and how to effectively address them.",
